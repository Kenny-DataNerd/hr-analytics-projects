This repository contains code, data, and documentation for my HR Analytics projects

ABOUT THE DATASET
The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle and was designed by Drs. Rich Huebner and Carla Patalano to accompany a case study designed for graduate HR students studying HR metrics, measurement, and analytics.. The data provided revolves around a fictitious company which I named Temler Limited.
