PROJECT TITLE: SYSTERS LIMITED

GOOGLE DATA ANALYTICS PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE
CASE STUDY




INTRODUCTION

Hello, I'm Kehinde Olorunsola, a Human Resource Practitioner, and recently certified as an Entry-level Data Analyst. As part of my final project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course, I had the opportunity to work on a case study for my portfolio. Given my passion for Human Resource Management, I decided to focus my project on this area of interest.



SCENARIO

I am a junior data analyst working for a business intelligence consultant. I have been at your job for six months, and my boss feels you are ready for more responsibility. He has asked me to lead a project for a brand new client â€” this will involve everything from defining the business task all the way through presenting my data-driven recommendations. Instruction: I will choose the topic, ask the right questions, identify a fresh dataset and ensure its integrity, conduct analysis, create compelling data visualizations, and prepare a presentation.



ABOUT THE COMPANY

The dataset used for this project is obtained from [Kaggle]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set/code)) and was designed by Drs. Rich Huebner and Carla Patalano who are the original authors of this dataset to accompany a case study designed for graduate HR students studying HR metrics, measurement, and analytics.. The data provided revolves around a fictitious company which I named Systers Limited.
